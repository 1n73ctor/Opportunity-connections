    <p>At Opportunity Connections, we value your privacy and make every effort to respect your wishes and personal information. In line with this commitment, we have established the following policy for the use of our SMS marketing service. Please read it carefully to understand how we collect, use, and manage your phone numbers.</p>

    <h3>COLLECTION OF PHONE NUMBERS</h3>
    <p>We collect your phone numbers only when you voluntarily provide them to us, for example, during transactions, inquiries, or when you sign up for our promotional messages. You can opt in to receive these SMS messages either by clicking on the Learn More button (which shows on the front of the website <a href="https://opportunityconnectionsusa.com">opportunityconnectionsusa.com</a>).</p>

    <h3>USE OF PHONE NUMBERS FOR SMS</h3>
    <p>Your phone numbers are primarily used to provide you with personalized services, updates, and promotional offers. These text messages may relate to our products, services, discounts, or any updates that we think may interest you. We may also provide special discounts or offers through SMS messages. SMS messaging charges may be applied by your carrier. We will only share your phone number with our SMS provider, subject to their privacy policy.</p>

    <h3>OPTING OUT OF MARKETING MESSAGES</h3>
    <p>If at any time you wish to stop receiving marketing SMS from us, you can opt out by:</p>

        <li>Texting <strong>STOP</strong> to opt-out</li>
        <li>Texting <strong>UNSUBSCRIBE</strong> to opt-out</li>
        <li>Texting <strong>CANCEL</strong> to opt-out</li>
        <li>Texting <strong>QUIT</strong> to opt-out</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that the opt-out process may take up to 1-2 business days to become effective. During this period, you may still receive some messages from us.</p>

    <h3>PRIVACY OF PHONE NUMBERS</h3>
    <p>Once you have opted out, we will not send you any more SMS messages, nor will we sell or transfer your phone number to another party.</p>

    <h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>
    <p>We may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your information by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
